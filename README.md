# LLM is all you need
Equip yourself with the power of all useful knowledge through LLM.

Some specific scenarios are marked with numbers. General content is not marked.



# 1. Code

## Useful combination

Some tool approaches to achieve dialogue and associate project files with LLM interaction:
- cursor/windsurf/Trae(free👍)
- vscode + copilot with built-in gpt4o, o1 preview, sonnet (free for edu email)
- vscode + roo cline + various LLMs (deepseek...) (OpenRoute or gemini flash API for free)



## Tools/tricks

- Better project file structure reading for large models [Repo Prompt](https://repoprompt.com/);
- [yamadashy/repomix: 📦 Repomix (formerly Repopack) is a powerful tool that packs your entire repository into a single, AI-friendly file. Perfect for when you need to feed your codebase to Large Language Models (LLMs) or other AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) 
- GitHub code summarization master [Gitingest](https://gitingest.com/);

ps: gitingest and repomix are similar and better to use locally which gitingest is friendly to python.

# 3. Research

## Writing

[【Practical Demonstration】Only 5min needed! Using ChatGPT to complete a SCI paper!_哔哩哔哩_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1jC4y1J7Wc/?spm_id_from=333.1387.upload.video_card.click&vd_source=762d1c17ffbeb091e5b069e774a31b4d) The use of prompts here is excellent.

Key considerations:
- Whether references are generated accurately;
- It's best to provide related articles for reference or integration.

# Prompts

All prompts I used can be achieved: `/Resources/prompts.md`



From @欲买桂花同载酒: 

Copilot configuration rules:

[Tips & Tricks for GitHub Copilot Chat in Visual Studio - Visual Studio (Windows) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/copilot-chat-context?view=vs-2022#prompting-guidance)

- Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in the project folder.
- Enable the feature in Visual Studio via **Tools** > **Options** > **GitHub** > **Copilot** > select **(Preview) Enable custom instructions to be loaded from .github/copilot-instructions.md files and added to requests.**

For cursor, simply configure the rules.

[17-year-old high school student writes a god-level Prompt, directly enhancing Claude to full-blooded o1.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IAKD0FfcYehs5FsDkLbTJQ)

[A "super prompt" that makes LLMs more creative](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/U99Qalq9RO9LIcDP6bPB1w)
The "super prompt" includes the following four core dimensions:
- Encourage curiosity: Push LLMs to dig deeper into thinking.
- Inspire association: Enhance LLMs' associative abilities to generate more creative content.
- Promote reflection: Guide LLMs to reflect and deepen problems, making more logical reasoning.
- Cultivate empathy: Make LLMs more human-like, generating responses with more emotional resonance.

The steps to use the "super prompt" are very simple: In tasks requiring divergent thinking or creativity, first input the "super prompt" to the LLM. Then ask related questions, and the LLM will provide deeper, more abstract answers under the guidance of the prompt. You can also build a GPT environment to continuously ask questions, allowing the LLM to generate highly creative answers.

Kimi's prompt experts are also very useful:

[Conversation with Prompt Experts - Kimi.ai](https://kimi.moonshot.cn/kimiplus/conpg00t7lagbbsfqkq0)

The structure is relatively simple, mainly including the following parts:

```
- Role
- Background
- Profile
- Skills
- Goals
- Constrains
- OutputFormat
- Workflow
- Examples
- Initialization
```

Since Kimi's default language is Chinese, you can specify the need for English writing in the declaration, such as "I need you to write R code based on my requirements, and I need you to write it in English."
